The application consists of two modules:  

    * Compose
    * Upload

### Compose 

Features:

    * Text and Image insertion on a blank canvas
    * Dragging the canvas elements anywhere within the canvas
    * Values and coordinates retention on refresh
    * Document printing/downloading as PDFs
    * Document preview
    * Zoom in and out anywhere in the canvas 
    * Coordinates display on any given element in the canvas
    * Intuitive UI

### Upload

Features:
    
    * Upload documens including PDFs
    * Lists the uploaded documents
    * Stores a shallow copy of documents in localStorage
    * Intuitive UI here as well


# Setup

Just

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

and you should be good to go


# Things to do
<!-- * Add some shadows -->
<!-- * Coords should clear when the document clears -->
<!-- * Store the uploaded files in localStorage -->
<!-- * Make the TCanvasContextActionType type actually work when dispatching actions -->
<!-- * Make the documents iterable which means there should be multiple documents in the state  -->
<!-- * Reproduce the sidebar disappearing error -->
<!-- * Create a select list for selecting an active document -->
<!-- * Fix the preview state -->
<!--     * fix the document top margin for good -->
<!--     * Fix the document height -->
<!-- * Clear the coords when the selected component in deleted -->

* Show the selected document in the canvas and make it bug free
* Enforce a limit of 1 megabytes for PDF uploading !!!
* Handle multiple file uploads and its connection to the state
* Write some good documentation this time
* CanvasChildren problem is back

* Clear as many 'any' types as possible
* Check for BS document ids
* Look into dragging and dropping of selected tools (if not possible, implement a better UX with cursor indication)
